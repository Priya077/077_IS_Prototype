# Problem Statement:
Online banking makes our life easier. Nowadays we are using credit/debit card to purchase products online. Is it safe?
The pandemic has led to increased crime risk all around the world and credit/debit card fraud is one of them. People are facing some problems like some unknown person had withdrawn money or made transaction through their cards through online purchasing. Recently, I have seen that one of my family members faced this problem. He got a message that someone used his credit card to purchase a costly item. Here, it is also important to mention that card is not lost. After getting this message, he blocked this card immediately to avoid this and applied for a new card. Unfortunately, we can’t say that in future this will not happen with the new one.
When we are using cards for online purchasing or anything else, we are using either card details or OTP. So it may be that the card details are available to the fraudsters through insider in the bank, the OTP is procured by them by deceiving the account holder to share the OTP on the pretext that it is required for any kind of verification.
In our country, there are many people those have debit/credit cards, but they don't have enough idea. As a result, they are suffering from this kind of fraud. So, there should be a solution so that except the owner of the card no one can use the card or track the details of the card. 
# Proposed Solution:
In proposed System, user’s spending pattern as well as location will be used to verify his identity using machine learning. If any unusual pattern is detected, the system requires reverification. Because there is a chance that due lack of significant amount of previous record, system is predicting normal transaction as fraudulent one. Here, more than 20-30% deviation of user transaction (spending history and operating country) is considered as an invalid attempt and system will take an action.
If the prediction is that the transaction is fraudulent, an SMS warning will be sent to the customer for confirmation before the amount is going to be deducted from the account.
